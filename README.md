This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
It is a parody of spotify wrapped using the data you can download  

## Getting Started

1. Create an empty folder named 'data' 
2. Place your [downloaded spotify data](https://support.stats.fm/docs/import/spotify-import/) in another folder named 'history'

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
